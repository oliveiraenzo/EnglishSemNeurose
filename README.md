# 🇬🇧 English Sem Neurose

**English Sem Neurose** is a social project dedicated to bringing **free and playful English education** to children living in vulnerable communities in Brazil. We believe that learning a new language can open doors, build confidence, and create opportunities — especially when it’s taught with empathy, joy, and cultural relevance.

## 🌍 Purpose

Our mission is to teach English in a **welcoming and fun** way to children aged **6 to 15**, focusing not just on language acquisition, but on:

- 🧠 **Empowerment** – Helping children believe in their own potential  
- 🎨 **Creativity** – Using games, music, storytelling, and art as tools for learning  
- ❤️ **Inclusion** – Creating safe and supportive learning spaces for all  

We’re committed to breaking the stereotype that English is only for a privileged few. Here, it’s for everyone — no pressure, no fear, no neurose. 😉

## 🏫 Where It Happens

Classes take place **in person** in communities and schools that welcome our volunteers. We build connections with families and local leaders to ensure our work has a real and lasting impact.
